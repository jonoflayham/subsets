# subsets

## The problem

`Occurrences` is a `List` of pairs of characters and positive integers saying how often the character appears.

This list is sorted alphabetically w.r.t. to the character in each pair.

All characters in the occurrence list are lowercase.

The aim is to produce all possible subsets of occurrences, as occurrence lists.

Any list of pairs of lowercase characters and their frequency which is not sorted is **not** an occurrence list.

Note: If the frequency of some character is zero, then that character should not be in the list.
